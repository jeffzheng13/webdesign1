<h2><i>The Invention</i></h2>
<hr />
<p><q>The history of basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts by James Naismith,</q>according to Wikipedia. He invented basketball in order to create a sport less injury-prone than football. The game soon grew in popularity and is played by millions around the world today.</p>
<h3>Original Rules</h3>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_basketball">
<p> There were only thirteen rules of "basket ball" when it was invented. They were:</p>


<ol>
<li>The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.</li>
<li>The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands.</li>
<li>A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at good speed.</li>
<li>The ball must be held in or between the hands, the arms or body must not be used for holding it.</li>
<li>No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute.</li>
<li>A foul is striking the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5.</li>
<li>If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count a goal for opponents.</li>
<li>A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the basket and stays there. If the ball rests on the edge and the opponent moves the basket it shall count as a goal.</li>
<li>When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and played by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The "thrower-in" is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them.</li>
<li>The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls, and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made.</li>
<li>The referee shall be the judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in-bounds, and to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.
</li>
<li>The time shall be fifteen-minute halves, with five-minute rests between.</li>
<li>The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In the case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>The Rise of</strong> <del>Amateur</del><ins>Professional Basketball</ins></h3>
<p> The first professional league was founded in 1898. Then in June 6, 1946, what is now known as the <b><em><abbr title="National Basketball League"> NBA</abbr></em></b> was created. It did not start out that way however. It first began as the NBA and the <abbr title="American Basketball Association">ABA</abbr>. It wasn't until 1976 that the modern NBA was formed.</p>
