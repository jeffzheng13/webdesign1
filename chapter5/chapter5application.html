<h3>Books</h3>
<p> Being an avid reader, I have probably read about a thousand books in my lifetime. I constantly have a new favorite book series. At this point, the <i>Legend Trilogy </i> is my favorite. The book is action-packed and I read the whole series within a week. </p>

<p>My favorite artist is Drake. His music is at its best when preparing for a sport game because it gets you hyped up.</p>
